Sara's Automated Background Removal Evaluator
A Streamlit web application for validating AI-generated background removal ratings, combining automated evaluation with human-in-the-loop feedback. The tool enables human annotators to review the AI's quality assessments and provide thumbs-up/down responses along with alternative rating suggestions.
Features
	•	AI Evaluation Simulation: Demonstrates automated background removal quality assessment
	•	Human Validation Interface: Thumbs up/down feedback system for AI ratings
	•	Annotator Rating System: Alternative rating input when disagreeing with AI assessments
	•	Analysis Dashboard: Comprehensive analysis of agreement rates and validation metrics
	•	Interactive Results: Visual feedback with celebration animations and detailed reporting
Demo Data
The application includes sample image pairs representing:
	•	Florist portraits
	•	Business professional photos
	•	Product photography (iPhone)
	•	Food photography (steak meals)
	•	Action shots (bowl splash)
Installation
	1	Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sara-ai-evaluation-validator.git
cd sara-ai-evaluation-validator
	2	Install required dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
	3	Run the Streamlit app:

bash
streamlit run app.py
Usage
	1	Start Evaluation: Click "Start AI Evaluation" to simulate AI processing of image pairs
	2	Validate Ratings: Review each AI rating and provide thumbs up (agree) or thumbs down (disagree) feedback
	3	Provide Alternative Ratings: For disagreements, select your preferred rating (1-5 scale)
	4	Submit Responses: Complete the validation process once all feedback is provided
	5	View Analysis: Review comprehensive analysis of agreement rates and recommendations
Quality Rating Scale
	•	1 - Not Viable: Poor quality, major artifacts
	•	2 - Partially Viable: Some issues, needs improvement
	•	3 - Moderately Functional: Acceptable with minor issues
	•	4 - Near Production Ready: High quality, minimal issues
	•	5 - Production Ready: Excellent quality, ready for use
