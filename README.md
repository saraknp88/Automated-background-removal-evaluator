## üí¨ About

Hybrid Background Removal Evaluator App is a Streamlit web application designed to validate AI-generated background removal scores for images through human-in-the-loop review. It combines automated quality assessment with manual oversight to ensure production-level readiness. Annotators are presented with side-by-side views of original and processed images, along with the AI‚Äôs rating based on a consistent 5-point rubric. They can agree with the score via a simple thumbs-up or flag a disagreement by thumbs down and submitting an alternative score. The tool also includes magnifying functionality for closer inspection, making it easier to spot edge artifacts or incomplete extractions. All interactions follow the same rubric used by the AI, ensuring consistency across evaluations. An analysis dashboard provides executive summary, insights into agreement rates, and actionable recommendations, helping teams make informed go/no-go decisions for deployment.
